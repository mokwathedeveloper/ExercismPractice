# Annalyn's Infiltration – Go Booleans Practice

This exercise is part of a learning module focused on **Booleans** in the Go programming language. You’ll implement logical conditions for actions that a character named Annalyn can take during her infiltration mission.

## Learning Goals

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand and use the `bool` type in Go
- Apply logical operators: `&&`, `||`, and `!`
- Practice control flow using conditional logic

## Introduction to Booleans in Go

Booleans in Go are represented by the predeclared type `bool`. A boolean value can be either `true` or `false`.

```go
var closed bool       // false by default
speeding := true      // true
hasError := false     // false
